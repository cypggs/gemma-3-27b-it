## Introduction

QwQ is the reasoning model of the Qwen series. Compared with conventional instruction-tuned models, QwQ, which is capable of thinking and reasoning, can achieve significantly enhanced performance in downstream tasks, especially hard problems. QwQ-32B is the medium-sized reasoning model, which is capable of achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art reasoning models, e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o1-mini.

**This repo contains the QwQ 32B model**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training (Supervised Finetuning and Reinforcement Learning)
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
- Number of Parameters: 32.5B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 31.0B
- Number of Layers: 64
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV
- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens

**Note:** For the best experience, please review the [usage guidelines](#usage-guidelines) before deploying QwQ models.

You can try our [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Qwen/QwQ-32B-Demo) or access QwQ models via [QwenChat](https://chat.qwen.ai).

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwq-32b/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Requirements

QwQ is based on Qwen2.5, whose code has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers`. We advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

## Quickstart

Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/QwQ-32B"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "How many r's are in the word \"strawberry\""
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)

model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=32768
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
print(response)
```

### Usage Guidelines

To achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:

1. **Enforce Thoughtful Output**: Ensure the model starts with "\<think\>\n" to prevent generating empty thinking content, which can degrade output quality. If you use `apply_chat_template` and set `add_generation_prompt=True`, this is already automatically implemented, but it may cause the response to lack the \<think\> tag at the beginning. This is normal behavior.

2. **Sampling Parameters**:
   - Use Temperature=0.6 and TopP=0.95 instead of Greedy decoding to avoid endless repetitions.
   - Use TopK between 20 and 40 to filter out rare token occurrences while maintaining the diversity of the generated output.

3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.
   - **Math Problems**: Include "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}." in the prompt.
   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: "Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g.,`\"answer\": \"C\"`." in the prompt.

4. **Handle Long Inputs**: For inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, enable [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071) to improve the model's ability to capture long-sequence information effectively.

For supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:
```json
{
  ...,
  "rope_scaling": {
    "factor": 4.0,
    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,
    "type": "yarn"
  }
}
```

For deployment, we recommend using vLLM. Please refer to our [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html) for usage if you are not familar with vLLM.
Presently, vLLM only supports static YARN, which means the scaling factor remains constant regardless of input length, **potentially impacting performance on shorter texts**. 
We advise adding the `rope_scaling` configuration only when processing long contexts is required.

## Evaluation & Performance
